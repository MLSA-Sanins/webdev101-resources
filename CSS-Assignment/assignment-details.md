### DOs & DONTs

1. Discuss with your teammates, peers and mentors to improve your website design
2. Take help from Google and learn from all the free resources available on the internet
3. If you didn't understand any concept from the resources available on the internet, you can discuss with your peers and mentors on our Community discord server.
4. You are not allowed to copy other Team's design. Create your own design. Take reference and ideas from portfolio websites available on the internet, Adrain Twarog YT, GitHub or CodePen, etc.
5. You are not allowed to copy paste code from anywhere. You may copy code if you are modifying that copied code to design your own components in the website. You are not allowed to directly put copied components that are readily available on the internet. You may be later asked about how you designed each and every component.
